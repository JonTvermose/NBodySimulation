# N_Body_Simulation in Java

A N body gravity simulation done in Java. GUI in JavaFX lets you choose the number of bodies (maximum of 125.000). Only planets, stars and black hole contribute to the gravity in the n_body simulation. The remaining objects are in that sense massless (their mass is tiny anyway).

The physics calculation part is based on http://physics.princeton.edu/~fpretori/Nbody/code.htm
